PROJECT OVERVIEW:
"BOOK SWAP - Online Book Reselling and Purchase" project is like a super-smart computer program. It brings together the parts of buying and selling books, doing something special by letting people trade books instead of always buying new ones. Imagine it as a virtual bookstore on the internet where people can easily look through lots of books, pick the ones they like, and put them in a virtual cart. When people want to get a book, the system helps people by asking for important details like where to send it and how to pay for it. Unlike regular systems, this one also lets sellers guess the price of their books and gives buyers special deals on certain types of books. It even lets people donate
 
books to help others or trade cool book-related things like posters or bookmarks. There is also a feature where people can borrow books for a bit, and in the future, it is being planned to add digital and audio books. It is like a really smart and helpful friend for book lovers.

TECHNOLOGY OVERVIEW:

Following are the technologies used to develop the system:
Front end: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap
Back end: Node.js
Database: MongoDB
